Description: This table lists resource data for area projectiles. The original engine had these hardcoded in the .exe

Columns -
   RESOURCE1 - A BAM resref which is drawn in the entire area of effect.
   RESOURCE2 - A VVC (or BAM) resref which is drawn in the center of effect once.
   RESOURCE3 - An alternate animation (named recoil without better name)
   SOUND1    - Explosion sound (played on first explosion)
   SOUND2    - Area sound (played on subsequent explosions)
   FLAGS     - a bitfield which alters the way the resources are drawn

Values for the FLAGS bitfield -
   1       - RESOURCE1 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
   2       - fills the entire area of effect randomly, otherwise it is a (spreading) circle
   4       - no spreading, the filler graphic is already at its destination, otherwise it starts from the center
   8       - RESOURCE2 is recoloured by the gradient set in the projectile
   0x10    - repopulate children that vanished
   0x20    - the child projectiles need gradient colouring
   0x40    - draw RESOURCE3 projectiles too (halves the number of children as well)
   0x80    - double the number of child projectiles
   0x100   - if none was affected by this projectile, apply a spell of same name on the caster
   0x200   - multiple directions
   0x400   - limit affected targets by total HD
   0x1000  - tiled animation
   0x2000  - play once

areapro.2da data could be completely incorporated into the projectile file, it is supplied
only for some BG2 spells that don't use the extended projectile format.

Use 255 for "Set off animation" in the projectile area extension in DLTCEP to avoid using
this table accidentally.

See projectile.txt for more information.
